# Lemmon

The objective is a toolkit for symbolic logic -- based on the system of E.J. Lemmon (and Patrick Suppes) and Haskell (or possibly Agda). 

## To Do List

1. Create data types for Proposition, ProofLine, and Proof
2. Define Reconstrual, Extension of Reconstrual, and Substitution
3. Export a proof (qua Haskell data type) to txt, LaTeX, and possibly Markdown. (Get the length of the longest formula for formatting purposes?)
